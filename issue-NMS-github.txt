##### System information (version)
- OpenCV => 4.3.0 (opencv-python via pip) 
- Operating System / Platform => Windows 64 Bit


##### Detailed description
When setting `top_k>0` in `NMSBoxes`, I dont always get the expected number of boxes in output.  
With top_k=4 I get 2 boxes, top_k=5 I get 3 boxes.  

With top_k<0 the output make sense, such that I could recover the top_k after the NMS but that's not really optimal.   
I'm wondering if it's related to this PR https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/16828, but it should be fixed in 4.3.0 ðŸ¤”  
I also tried casting the boxes to float (hence the lambda function) but it does not change the output.  
Or am I missing something in the function definition ?

I also observe it with some java binding (via javacv), so I think it might not be specific to those particular bindings.

##### Issue submission checklist

 - [X] I report the issue, it's not a question
   <!--
   OpenCV team works with answers.opencv.org, Stack Overflow and other communities
   to discuss problems. Tickets with question without real issue statement will be
   closed.
   -->
 - [X] I checked the problem with documentation, FAQ, open issues,
       answers.opencv.org, Stack Overflow, etc and have not found solution
   <!--
   Places to check:
   * OpenCV documentation: https://docs.opencv.org
   * FAQ page: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/FAQ
   * OpenCV forum: https://answers.opencv.org
   * OpenCV issue tracker: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues?q=is%3Aissue
   * Stack Overflow branch: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/opencv
   -->
 - [X] I updated to latest OpenCV version and the issue is still there
   <!--
   master branch for OpenCV 4.x and 3.4 branch for OpenCV 3.x releases.
   OpenCV team supports only latest release for each branch.
   The ticket is closed, if the problem is not reproduced with modern version.
   -->
 - [X] There is reproducer code and related data files: videos, images, onnx, etc
   <!--
   The best reproducer -- test case for OpenCV that we can add to the library.
   Recommendations for media files and binary files:
   * Try to reproduce the issue with images and videos in opencv_extra repository
     to reduce attachment size
   * Use PNG for images, if you report some CV related bug, but not image reader
     issue
   * Attach the image as archite to the ticket, if you report some reader issue.
     Image hosting services compress images and it breaks the repro code.
   * Provide ONNX file for some public model or ONNX file with with random weights,
     if you report ONNX parsing or handling issue. Architecture details diagram
     from netron tool can be very useful too. See https://lutzroeder.github.io/netron/
